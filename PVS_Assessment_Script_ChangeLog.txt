#Version 1.11 12-Sep-2016
#	Added an alias AA for AdminAddress to match the other scripts that use AdminAddress
#	Added output to appendixes to show if nothing was found
#	Added checking for $ComputerName parameter when testing PVS services
#	Changed the "No unassociated vDisks found" to "<None found>" to match the changes to the other Appendixes
#	Fixed an issue where Appendix I was not output
#	Fixed error message in output when no PVS services were found (said No Bootstraps found)
#	If remoting is used (-AdminAddress), check if the script is being run elevated. If not,
#		show the script needs elevation and end the script
#	Removed all references to $ErrorActionPreference since it is no longer used

#Version 1.10 8-Sep-2016
#	Added Appendix K for 33 Misc Registry Keys
#		Miscellaneous Registry Items That May or May Not Exist on Servers
#		These items may or may not be needed
#		This Appendix is strictly for server comparison only
#	Added Break statements to most of the Switch statements
#	Added checking the NIC's "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" setting
#	Added function Get-RegKeyToObject contributed by Andrew Williamson @ Fujitsu Services
#	Added testing for $Null –eq $DiskLocators. PoSH V2 did not like that I forgot to do that.
#	Added to the console and report, lines when nothing was found for various items being checked.
#	Cleaned up duplicate IP addresses appearing in Appendix J.
#		Changed NICIPAddressess from array to hashtable
#		Reset the StreamingIPAddresses array between servers
#	Moved the initialization of arrays to the top of the script instead of inside a function.
#	PoSH V2 did not like the “4>$Null”. I test for V2 now and use “2>$Null”.
#	Script now works properly with PoSH V2 and PVS 5.x.x.
#	Since PoSH V2 does not work with the way I forced Verbose on, I changed all the Write-Verbose statements to Write-Host. 
#		You should not be able to tell any difference.
#	With the help and patience of Andrew Williamson and MBS, the script should now work with PVS servers that have multiple NICs

#Version 1.04 1-Aug-2016
#	Added back missing AdminAddress, User and Password parameters
#	Fixed several invalid output lines

#Version 1.03 22-Feb-2016

#Version 1.02 17-Feb-2016
#	In help text, changed the DLL registration lines to not wrap
#	In help text, changed the smart quotes to regular quotes
#	Added for Appendix E a link to the Citrix article on DisableTaskOffload
#	Added link to PVS server sizing for server RAM calculation
#	Added comparing Streaming IP addresses to the IP addresses configured for the server
#		If a streaming IP address does not exist on the server, it is an invalid streaming IP address
#		This is a bug in PVS that allows invalid IP addresses to be added for streaming IPs
